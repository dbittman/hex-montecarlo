Build: run 'make'

Execute: ./hex
The program takes in board size as an argument. No arguments results in a 
board size of 11.

The program will ask you who should go first. It is not case-sensitive. The
letter 'c' will indicate computer-goes-first, otherwise human player goes
first.

If the computer goes first, it will make a move, print the board, and ask if
you want to switch sides (pie rule). The computer will never ask to switch
sides if you go first.

After that, the game starts for real. Entered moves must be coordinates. It
will accept "10,4" or "10 4" as valid input formats (without quotes).

It will tell you when the game is over, and who has won.

There are two options that can be set inside the code files. Around line 20
int main.cpp are:

int debug
and
int num_iterations

Both these can be set to alter the behavior of the program. The debug flag will
print out the win percentage for each potential move, and the num_iterations flag
will tell it how many games to simulate for each potential move. I didn't make
these command line options because they don't need to be changed. These can be
edited to to make the computer run faster on slower hardware, or play better.
